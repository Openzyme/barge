In August Openzyme is launching not just a radical new device, but a radical new idea.

Mitosys is a device to grow your own cells at home.

Designed around the simple premise that biomedicine should be as accessible and connected as the internet.

With automatic peer-to-peer networking, Mitosys combines all the possibilities of biology with all the capabilities of computing.

All for 0.17 Eth.*

_Reserve your Mitosys device by sending 0.017 Eth to thetechnocrat.eth_

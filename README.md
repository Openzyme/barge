Planarian flatworms are model organisms for longevity, regeneration, and distributed memory.

The Flatworm Watcher is a device to carry out long running planarian studies.

Designed with infrared lighting to reduce the effects of planarian photosensitivity.

Pre-loaded with peer-to-peer networking for inter lab collaboration.

Funding graciously provided by [Impetus Grants](https://impetusgrants.org/news-and-updates/round-3-projects-funded).

### Mitosys [Under Research]

Mitosys is a device to grow your own cells at home.

Designed around the simple premise that biomedicine should be as accessible and connected as the internet.

With automatic peer-to-peer networking, Mitosys combines all the possibilities of biology with all the capabilities of computing.
